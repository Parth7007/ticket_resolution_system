AI-Powered IT Helpdesk Ticketing System
📝 Project Overview
This is an intelligent, full-stack IT Helpdesk Ticketing System designed for companies and teams to efficiently manage IT support tickets. The system leverages advanced AI/ML models to streamline ticket classification, prioritization, and resolution, providing a seamless experience for both users and IT administrators.
AI/ML Features:

Text Classification: Utilizes TF-IDF and XGBoost for automatic ticket type and priority classification based on text input.
OCR/Image Classification: Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with MobileNetV2 to process screenshot-based tickets and extract relevant information via OCR.
Generative AI: Integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by Groq or Ollama to generate automated ticket resolutions.

🚀 Features
User Features

Ticket Submission: Users can submit tickets via text or image uploads.
Solution Viewing: Users can view resolutions provided by admins for their tickets.

Admin Features

Ticket Management: Admins can view all tickets submitted across the system.
AI-Powered Resolutions: Admins can add resolutions generated by the GenAI model.
Resolution Download: Admins can download resolutions as .txt files.

System Features

Role-Based Dashboards: Separate dashboards for users and admins.
Intelligent ML/AI Pipeline: Combines text classification, OCR, and GenAI for efficient ticket processing.
Dual Database Architecture:
PostgreSQL: Handles text-based tickets and user authentication.
MongoDB Atlas: Stores image-based tickets and associated metadata.

Responsive Frontend: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a modern, user-friendly interface.

🔐 Authentication

JWT-Based Authentication: Secure login and signup for users and admins.
AuthContext: Manages authentication state in the frontend.
Route Protection: Ensures dashboards are accessible only to authorized users based on their roles.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend

React: For building dynamic, component-based UI.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
Vite: For fast development and building.
React Router DOM: For client-side routing.
Axios: For making API requests to the backend.

Backend

FastAPI: High-performance Python framework for building APIs.
SQLAlchemy: For PostgreSQL database operations.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization.
python-multipart: For handling file uploads (e.g., images).
PyMongo: For MongoDB Atlas integration.

ML/DL Models

Text Classification: TF-IDF + XGBoost with LabelEncoder for ticket type and priority.
Image Processing: MobileNetV2 (CNN) for screenshot-based ticket analysis.
Generative AI: LLM (Groq or Ollama) for generating ticket resolutions.

Databases

PostgreSQL: Stores text-based tickets and authentication data.
MongoDB Atlas: Stores image-based tickets and metadata.

💻 Installation Steps
🔧 Backend Setup
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ticket-resolution-system.git
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following:POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ticket_db
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ticket_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

Ensure ML models (TF-IDF, XGBoost, CNN) are saved in the ml_model/ directory.

🧪 ML Model Training (Optional)
If retraining is needed:

Train TF-IDF + XGBoost on labeled text ticket data.
Train MobileNetV2 (CNN) on image quality data for OCR tickets.
Save models using joblib or pickle to the ml_model/ directory.

🌐 Frontend Setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Create a .env file in the frontend directory:VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

🚀 Running the Full Stack

Start the backend:cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

Start the frontend:cd frontend
npm run dev

Open the application in your browser at: http://localhost:5173.

🧪 Testing & Usage

User Workflow:
Sign up as a user.
Submit a ticket (text or image-based).
View the resolution once provided by an admin.

Admin Workflow:
Sign up as an admin.
View all tickets in the admin dashboard.
Add AI-generated resolutions to tickets.
Download resolutions as .txt files.

Testing the AI Pipeline:
Submit an image-based ticket to test the OCR + CNN + GenAI pipeline.
